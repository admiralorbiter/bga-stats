- App is usable on mobile devices

### Testing Scenarios

1. **First Import (Each Type)**: Empty DB → Import → Browse
2. **Re-Import (Each Type)**: Same data → No duplicates
3. **Invalid Input (Each Type)**: Bad format → Error message
4. **Cross-Type**: Import games, then player stats → games linked correctly
5. **Large Scale**: Import 100+ players, games, tournaments → performance acceptable

## Sprint Management Notes

### Sprint Duration Guidelines

- **Short sprints (1-2 hours)**: Simple setup tasks
- **Medium sprints (3-4 hours)**: Feature implementation
- **Long sprints (4-6 hours)**: Complex features or integration

### Sprint Completion Criteria

Each sprint is considered complete when:
- [ ] All tasks are done
- [ ] Deliverables are working
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Testing is completed

### Sprint Review

After each sprint:
1. Review what was completed
2. Test deliverables
3. Note any blockers or issues
4. Adjust next sprint if needed

### Sprint Retrospective

At end of Phase 1:
1. What went well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What patterns emerged?
4. How to apply learnings to Phase 2?
